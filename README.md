### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Megan Miller, and I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan set to graduate in December 2024. My GitHub hosts a mix of academic and practical projects that reflect my commitment to learning and applying computer science concepts.

During the summer of 2022, I honed my skills at Meta as a University Engineering Intern in the iOS development track, where I created [Soundroom](https://github.com/megmil/Soundroom), a real-time votable music queue app.

As the Software Lead for the Michigan Electric Boat project team, I've led key developments in our boat's technology stack. My hands-on work includes programming the [Vehicle Control Unit](https://github.com/uofmelectricboat/tide-vcu) with MATLAB Simulink in compliance with the CAN communication protocol, creating a dynamic [team website](https://github.com/uofmelectricboat/umeb.engin.umich.edu) with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and building an [in-boat driver display](https://github.com/uofmelectricboat/tide-main-display) with the power of Qt/QML/C++. You can find these contributions on our Michigan Electric Boat team page: https://github.com/uofmelectricboat.

With a skill set that spans C++, Swift, Objective-C, Qt/QML, Python, HTML/CSS/Javascript, and Julia, my GitHub contributions reflect a journey of challenging academic foundations and innovative engineering feats. Enjoy browsing through my projects!
